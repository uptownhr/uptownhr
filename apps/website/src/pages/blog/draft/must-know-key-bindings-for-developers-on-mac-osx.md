Please put your VIM vs EMACS feelings aside for a moment. These key bindings are universal and will help you keep your 
fingers on the main keyboard, avoiding the need to lift your fingers for the home or arrow keys. What's great is that
these bindings work in the shell, in your editor and even apps like google docs. This is all because OSX respects the 
EMACS bindings natively and actually reserved the Ctrl key for this purpose; vs in Windows where the Ctrl key is used 
by the application and the OS.

## Ctrl + p: next line

## Ctrl + n: previous line

## Ctrl + k: kill line from cursor to end

## Ctrl + a: move to beginning of line

## Ctrl + p: move to end of line
